# Fuzzy-Vent-Fan-Controller
Arduino based vent fan controller.
High humidity levels are often considered bad for homes. Many companies sell in­ceiling 
vent­fans. These vent fans are efficient at removing hot moist air from bathrooms and 
offensive odors from restrooms. The trouble with these vent­fans is that we often leave them 
on for too long, or just forget to turn them off. However there is also the problem of not leaving 
the vent fans on long enough which over the course of years can cause damage to the home. 
 
The proposed project remedies both of these cases by using a Fuzzy Logic Controller and a 
humidity/temperature sensor to control the vent fan.
